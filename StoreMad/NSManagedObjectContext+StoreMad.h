 With any of these methods, you have to respect the NSManagedObjectContext internal queues. It's 
 recommended that you wrap a bunch of context work in a performBlock, or performBlockAndWait. Methods
 that provide their own blocks specifically say so in the method name. For example, `queueBlockSave`
 will queue a block save on the context.

 Creates a new managed object context based on the current contexts persistent store.

 Note: You have to allocate the threadSafeCopy on the thread you want to use it with.
