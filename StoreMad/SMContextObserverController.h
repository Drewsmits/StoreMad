/**
 Returns an opaque class of SMContextObserver. The workBlock will be executed
 every time the context fires a notification of the notificationType. For instance, 
 you could set a predicate to observe a specific object change in a given context
 every time the context saves, firing a NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification.
 
 Optionally, you can pass in an NSOperationQueue to run the workBlock on. This is
 useful if you have a long running task. If nil, the workBlock will be executed on
 whatever thread the context fires the NSNotifiation. Most likely this is the main thread.
 
 @param context The context to observe
 @param predicate The predicate used to filter
 @param notificationName The NSManagedObjectContext notifications. Valid values
 include NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification, NSManagedObjectContextWillSaveNotification,
 and NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification.
 @param queue The NSOperationQueue to run the workBlock on. If nil, the workBlock will
 be run on the main thread.
 @param workBlock The work block to run on the updated, inserted, and deleted objects
 involved in the notification.
